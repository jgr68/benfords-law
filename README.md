Benfords Law
-------------
A lightweight interpretation of the Benford's Law Fraud detection script
used by the IRS.

Description
-----------
This python script uses Benford's Law to search for signs of
check fraud in a list of account files. To use the script, simply place
benford.py in a directory with multiple .txt files containing checking
account numbers, then run the script.

The script will read in each of the .txt files before using Benford's
Law to determine which files contain the fake account numbers.
